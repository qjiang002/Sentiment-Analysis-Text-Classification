witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful .	1
sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .	-1
miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .	1
[raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see .	1
like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome .	1
jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema .	1
the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut .	-1
maryam is more timely now than ever .	1
it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds .	1
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon .	-1
this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground .	1
yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't .	-1
with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking .	1
from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir .	1
a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles .	1
i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson .	1
mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage .	1
heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations .	-1
spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .	-1

it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame .	-1
[w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .	-1
a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point .	1
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .	-1
stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be .	1

a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema	1
serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .	-1
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .	-1
. . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . .	1

ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years .	1
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters .	-1

a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile .	1
its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart .	1
more trifle than triumph .	-1
it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman .	1

while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel .	1
sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' .	1
viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic .	1
baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations .	1

" punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . .	1
this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun .	1

take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he'll be your slave for a year .	1
what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight	1

steers , in his feature film debut , has created a brilliant motion picture .	1

it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either .	-1

the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .	-1
does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?	-1
notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-	1

the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers .	1
sex with strangers is fascinating . . .	1
at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .	-1
by turns very dark and very funny .	1
director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together .	1
like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .	-1
as i settled into my world war ii memories , i found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances .	1

it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy .	-1
blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances .	1
imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy .	1
a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .	-1
for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must !	1
. . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with .	1
this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .	-1
just a bloody mess .	-1
it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary .	-1
it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them .	1
even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential .	-1
a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .	-1
payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business .	1
for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed .	1
i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes .	-1

berling and b√©art . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters .	1
fans of critics' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart .	1

nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too .	-1
if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother .	-1
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .	-1
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .	-1
we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .	-1
the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine .	-1
stale , futile scenario .	-1
an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‚Äòwhat you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances	1
all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness .	-1
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .	-1
the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher .	1
the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all .	1
in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon !	1
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making	-1
priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .	-1
predictably soulless techno-tripe .	-1
a limp eddie murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .	-1
the importance of being earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from bartlett's familiar quotations	1
it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .	-1
toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away .	1
a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature .	1
godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence .	1
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .	-1
this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper .	1
what sets ms . birot's film apart from others in the genre is a greater attention to the parents -- and particularly the fateful fathers -- in the emotional evolution of the two bewitched adolescents .	1
where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable .	1
some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .	-1
a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional .	-1
there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .	1
what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates .	1
if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film .	1
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .	-1
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .	-1
maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .	-1
jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) .	1
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .	-1
it's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless .	1
i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .	-1
witty , touching and well paced .	1
like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .	-1
i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno .	-1
the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .	-1
it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile .	1
a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide .	1
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .	-1
brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema .	1
viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .	-1
one of those movies that catches you up in something bigger than yourself , namely , an archetypal desire to enjoy good trash every now and then .	1
remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it .	1
with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone	1
overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .	-1
it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good .	1
the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here .	1
so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .	-1
it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable .	1
. . . the plot weaves us into a complex web .	1
'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '	-1
hardly a film that comes along every day .	1
this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable .	1
the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption .	-1
nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .	-1
" bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way .	-1
watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .	1
it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity .	1
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .	-1
all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .	-1
there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them .	-1
happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and doesn't pummel us with phony imagery or music .	1
because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions .	1
this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .	1
talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .	-1
the name says it all . jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of candid camera staged for the marquis de sade set .	-1
a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .	-1
no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand .	1
an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .	-1
none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .	-1
a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that .	1
a tremendous piece of work .	1
though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes .	1
formulaic to the 51st power , more like .	-1
the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .	-1
the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .	1
the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing .	1
this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .	-1
a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television .	1
denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .	-1
utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .	-1
a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships .	1
ourside the theatre roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he's well worth spending some time with .	1
in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough .	1
shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .	-1
the film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .	-1
seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .	1
if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi .	1
two hours of junk .	-1
watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia .	1
stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .	1
the script ? please .	-1
this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters .	1
. . . a rather bland affair .	-1
weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .	-1
by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing .	1
there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .	-1
the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries .	1
simply a re-hash of the other seven films .	-1
this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms .	1
degenerates into hogwash .	-1
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .	-1

a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .	-1
the first half bursts with a goofy energy previous disney films only used for a few minutes here and there .	1
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .	-1
not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend .	1
sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .	1
well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy .	-1
as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project .	1
instead of hiding pinocchio from critics , miramax should have hidden it from everyone .	-1
this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer .	1
the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list .	-1
an extraordinary dramatic experience .	1
it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire .	-1

if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles .	-1
it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame .	1
the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer .	1
an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss .	1
a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .	-1
bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid .	1
a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause .	1
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .	-1
possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose .	-1
don't waste your money .	-1
a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others .	1
go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .	-1
although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers .	1
[allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise .	1
solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke	-1
unpretentious , charming , quirky , original	1
christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .	-1
trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son .	1
the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul .	-1
cuaron repeatedly , perversely undercuts the joie de vivre even as he creates it , giving the movie a mournful undercurrent that places the good-time shenanigans in welcome perspective .	1
a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .	1
the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties .	1

filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .	-1
the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects ‚Äî from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .	-1
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .	-1

a melancholy , emotional film .	1
director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . .	1
it's just rather leaden and dull .	-1
a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode .	1

we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it .	1
the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .	-1
though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation .	-1

a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch .	1
its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .	1
suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .	-1
like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive .	1

the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one .	1
why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ?	-1
its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists .	-1

at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave .	-1
writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic .	1
wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together	-1
beautifully directed and convincingly acted .	1
it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing .	1
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .	-1
a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '	1
. . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume .	1
. . . planos fijos , tomas largas , un ritmo pausado y una sutil observaci√≥n de sus personajes , sin estridencias ni grandes revelaciones .	1
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .	-1
the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited .	1
the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand .	1
every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .	-1
if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .	-1
massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history .	1
it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time .	1
a " home alone " film that is staged like " rosemary's baby , " but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .	-1
[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .	-1
kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself .	-1
an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values .	1
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .	-1
a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .	1
. . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department .	1
it's definitely a step in the right direction .	1
a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film .	1
parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature .	1
that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace .	1
this is so bad .	-1
a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted .	1
despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before .	-1
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .	-1
it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism .	-1
the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .	1
the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired .	1
as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely .	-1
a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . .	1
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .	-1
the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .	-1
beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images .	1
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .	-1
episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .	-1
piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .	-1
in the disturbingly involving family dysfunctional drama how i killed my father , french director anne fontaine delivers an inspired portrait of male-ridden angst and the emotional blockage that accompanies this human condition	1
sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .	-1
the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way .	-1
unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .	-1
alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors .	-1
. . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .	-1
no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .	-1
the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .	-1
all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .	-1
an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title .	-1
any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years .	-1
like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right .	1
a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters .	1
the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .	-1
if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there .	1
you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .	-1
elvira fans could hardly ask for more .	1
a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising .	1
not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .	-1
it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality	1
this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .	-1
thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began .	1
granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek .	-1
doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez .	-1
what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ?	-1
escapism in its purest form .	1
a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system	1
not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches .	-1
'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '	1
‚Ä¶an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller .	1
like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing .	1
a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel .	-1
suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .	1
it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .	-1
gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it .	-1
viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .	-1
it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing .	1
a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last .	1
well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) .	-1
such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .	-1
the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .	-1
. . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .	-1
blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period .	-1
director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .	-1
both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver .	1
some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .	-1
often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part .	1
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does .	-1
a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .	-1
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .	-1
a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .	-1
a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours .	1
van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers .	-1
kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers .	1
it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains .	1
witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .	-1
. . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle .	-1
birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency .	1
'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '	1
. . . salaciously simplistic .	-1
instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .	1
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .	-1
to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .	-1
the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .	1
overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs .	1
how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [fran√ßois and mich√®le's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .	-1
late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet .	-1
mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . .	1
an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind .	1
too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .	-1
although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .	-1
one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever .	1
a beautifully observed character piece .	1
nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one .	1
an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' .	-1
it's weird , wonderful , and not necessarily for kids .	1
moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter .	1
a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .	-1
the writing is clever and the cast is appealing .	1
incoherence reigns .	-1
a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy .	1
romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures .	1
mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .	-1
sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .	1
that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed .	1
too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film .	-1
we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict .	-1
a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature .	1
despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable	-1
leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute .	1
if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet .	-1
there is so much plodding sensitivity .	-1
it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it .	-1
has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes .	-1
for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .	1
there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .	-1
you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .	-1
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .	-1
just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .	-1
cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .	-1
it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning .	-1
less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .	-1
an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see .	1
cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing .	1
. . . a bland , pretentious mess .	-1
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .	-1
so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .	-1
the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread .	1
it's all surface psychodramatics .	-1
from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .	1
at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture .	1
[fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills	1
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring .	-1
a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . a case in point : doug pray's scratch .	1
with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .	-1
when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean .	-1
even in this less-than-magic kingdom , reese rules .	-1
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .	-1
from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .	-1
full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000	1
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .	-1
the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .	-1
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .	-1
the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers .	1
the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .	-1
sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .	-1
maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors .	1
a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience .	1
what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn .	1
the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '	-1
whether or not you buy mr . broomfield's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr . broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover .	1
gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman .	1
[city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year .	1
the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .	-1
brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .	-1
goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .	-1
